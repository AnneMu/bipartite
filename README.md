repository for the bipartite R-package for network analysis


Hi,

this is the bipartite repository on github. Currently this package is maintained by Carsten Dormann, that's why the repository is hosted under this department.

It falls onto the maintainer to submit new versions to CRAN for release. All non-CRAN-versions are in development.

Since I do not use github everyday, please also send me an email if you add/change something (carsten.dormann@biom.uni-freiburg.de). Thanks!

For maximal confusion, the actual package content is in the "bipartite" subfolder, while other material, such as test files, wishlists, comments etc. are directly in this folder.

Carsten
