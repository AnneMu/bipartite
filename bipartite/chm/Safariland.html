<h2>Pollination web in Argentina.</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This pollination web was published by Vazquez and Simberloff (2003). See there for
details on how it was measured.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data(Safariland)</pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The dataset consists of a matrix with 9 rows, representing plant species and 27 columns,
representing different pollinators. Values in the matrix are observed flower visitations.
</p>
<p>
This dataset is fairly representative of a pollination web: more pollinators than plants,
and an awful lot of zeros in the matrix.
</p>
<p>
The study was conducted in four grazed and four ungrazed sites in and around Nahuel
Huapi National Park and surrounding areas in Rio Negro, Argentina from September 1999
to Feburary 2000. For each site, the plant-pollinator interaction network was described.
</p>
<p>
The authors recorded their data by counting the number of visits of each flower visitor
species to each plant species. Data are presented as an interaction frequency matrix,
in which cells with positive integers indicate the frequency of interaction between
a pair of species, and cells with zeros indicate no interaction.
