Description: Bipartite provides functions to visualise webs and calculate a series of indices commonly used to describe pattern in ecological webs. It focuses on webs consisting of only two trophic levels, e.g. pollination webs or predator-prey-webs. Visualisation is important to get an idea of what we are actually looking at, while the indices summarise different aspects of the webs topology.
